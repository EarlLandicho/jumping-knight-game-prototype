# Jumping Knight

![](Assets/jumping_knight_sample.gif)

This is small prototype that allows the player to control a knight that can attack enemies and treasure chests. This is a prototype for now. Jumping Knight is a 
2D action platformer where you swing a sword at enemies. As with my other prototpyes, I'm using this as a stepping stone to a bigger project.

Jumping Knight is made with Unity. I use Aseprite to create the pixel art.
